* Introduction 
\normalfont

In [[citetext:ElBoustani2009]], it was shown that using the stationary
solution to this euqation could describe the stationary activity of a
numerical network of identical neurons. We investigate here whether
this translates into the description of assymetric populations, and
more importantly whether the Markovien description can describe the
temporal dynamics in response to time-varying input.

We investigate whether the Markovian formalismm proposed in
[[citetext:ElBoustani2009]] is able to describe the temporal dynamics of
artificial neural networks. Answering this kind of question precisely
set what is the relevance of /stationary/ responses and what are real
transient effects.

* Material and Methods
\small

We describe the equations and parameters used for the neuronal,
synaptic and network modeling. We present our /heuristic/ treatment of
the neuronal /transfer functions/: the quantity that accounts for the
cellular computation in /mean-field/ models of population
activity. Then, we present the specific markovian model of population
activity used in this study. Finally, we embed this description of
local population dynamics in a ring model to describe spatio-temporal
integration on the neocortical sheet.

** Single neuron models

The neuronal model used in this study is the adaptative exponential
and fire (AdExp) model [[cite:Brette2005a]]. The equation for the membrane
potential and the adaptation current therefore reads:

#+NAME: eq:iAdExp
\begin{equation}
\hspace{-.2cm}
  \left\{
  \begin{split}
  & C_\mathrm{m}\,\frac{dV}{dt} = g_\mathrm{L} \,(E_\mathrm{L}-V) + I_{syn}(V,t) + k_a e^{\frac{V - V_{thre} }{k_a}}- I_w \\
  & \tau_w \frac{d I_w}{dt} = - I_w + \sum_{t_s \in \{t_{spike}\}} b \, \, \delta (t-t_s)
  \end{split}
\right.
\end{equation}

where $I_{syn}(V, t)$ is the current emulating synaptic activity that
will create the fluctuations, $I_w$ reproduces the I_m current
[[cite:McCormick1985]]. The spiking mechanism is the following: when
$V(t)$ reaches \(V_{thre}+5 \, k_a \), this triggers a spike t_s \in
\{t_{spike}\}, this increases the adaptation variable $I_w$ by \(b\),
the membrane potential is then clamped at \(E_L\) for a duration
\tau_{refrac}=5ms. We consider two versions of this model: a regular
spkiking neuron for the excitatory cells and a fast spiking neuron for
the inhibitory cells (see Figure [[fig:tf]]). The parameters of those two
models can be found on Table [[table:params]].

** Synaptic model

The time- and voltage-dependent current that stimulate the neuron is
made of the sum of an excitatory and inhibitory currents (indexed by
\(s \in \{e,i\}\) and having a reversal potential \(E_s\)):

#+NAME: eq:syn-current
\begin{equation}
 I_{syn}(V,t) = \sum_{s \in \{e,i\}} \sum_{t_s \in \{t_s\}} Q_s \, e^{-\frac{t}{\tau_s}} \, (E_{s}-V) \, \mathcal{H}(t-t_s)
\end{equation}
where \(\mathcal{H}\) is the Heaviside function.

This synaptic model is refered to as the /conductance-based
exponential/ synapse. The set of events \(\{t_e\}\) and \(\{t_i\}\)
are the set of excitatory and inhibitory events arriving to the
neuron. In numerical simulations of single neurons, it will be
generated by stationary Poisson processes. In numerical simulations of
network dynamics it will correspond to the set of spike times of the
neurons connecting to the targent neurons, both via recurrent and
feedforward connectivity.

** Numerical network model

All simulations of numerical network were performed with the =brian2=
simulator [[cite:Goodman2009]], see [[http://brian2.readthedocs.org]]. For all
simulations, the network was composed of \(N_{tot}\)=10000 neurons,
separated in two populations, one excitatory and one inhibitory with a
ratio of g=20% inhibitory cells. Those two populations we recurrently
connected (internally and mutually) with a connectivity probability
\(\epsilon\)=5%.

Because this network did not display self-sustained activity (see
Figure [[fig:phase-space]], in contrast to [[citetext:Vogels2005]]), an
excitatory population exerted an /external drive/ to bring the network
out of the quiescent state. This population targetted both the
excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Note that the firing rate of this
population was linearly increased to avoid a too strong initial
synchronization (see Figure [[fig:ntwk-act]]). Finally, an excitatory
population of time varying firing rate could was added to evoke
activity transients in the population dynamics. This last stimulation
targetted only the excitatory population. The number of neurons in
those two excitatory populations was taken as identical to the number
of excitatory neurons (i.e. \((1-g)\,N_{tot}\)) and created synapses
onto the recurrent network with the same probability
\(\epsilon\). After temporal discretization, the firing rates of those
afferent populations were converted into spikes by using the
properties of a Poisson process (i.e. eliciting a spike at \(t\) with
a probability \(\nu(t) \,dt \)). All simulations were performed with a
time-step dt=0.1ms.

** Estimating the transfer functions of single neurons

The transfer function \(\mathcal{F}\) of a single neuron is defined
here as the function that maps the value of the stationary excitatory
and inhibitory presynaptic release frequencies to the output
stationary firing rate response, i.e. \(\nu_{out} = \mathcal{F}(\nu_e,
\nu_i)\). Note the stationary hypothesis in the definition of the
transfer function (see discussion in main text).

Because an analytical solution of this function for the single neuron
models considered in our study is a very challenging mathematical
problem, we adopted a semi-analytical approach. We performed numerical
simulations of single cell dynamics at various excitatory and
inhibitory presynaptic frequencies (\(\nu_e\) and \(\nu_i\)
respectively) (see the output in Figure [[fig:tf]]) on which we fitted the
coefficients of an analytical template to capture the single cell
model's response.

The procedure relied on fitting a /phenomenological threshold/
\(V_{thre}^{eff}\) that accounts for the single neuron non-linearities
(spiking and reset mechanism, adaptation mechanisms) on top of the
subthreshold integration effects [[cite:Zerlaut2016]]. This
phenomenological threshold is then plugged-in into the following
formula (analogous to [[citetext:Amit1997]]) to become our firing response
estimate:

#+NAME: eq:template
\begin{equation}
  \nu_{out} = \frac{1}{2\,\tau_V} \cdot 
  {Erfc}(\frac{V_{thre}^{eff}-\mu_V}{\sqrt{2} \, \sigma_V})
\end{equation}

Where \( (\mu_V, \sigma_V, \tau_V) \) are the mean, standard deviation
and autocorrelation time constant of the membrane potential
fluctuations. How to calculate those quantities as a response to a
stationary stimulation is the focus of the next section.

The phenomenological threshold was taken as a second order polynomial
in the three dimensional space \( (\mu_V, \sigma_V, \tau_V) \):

#+NAME: eq:quadratic-threshold
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
   V_{thre}^{eff} & (\mu_V, \sigma_V, \tau_V^N) = P_0 + 
   \sum_{x \in \{ \mu_V, \sigma_V, \tau_V^N\}} P_x \cdot \Big(  \frac{x - x^0}{\delta x^0} \Big) + \\
   & \sum_{ x,y \in \{ \mu_V, \sigma_V, \tau_V^N\}^2} P_{xy} \cdot
   \Big( \frac{x - x^0}{\delta x^0}  \Big) \,  \Big( \frac{y - y^0}{\delta y^0} \Big)
 \end{split}
\end{equation}

Where the normalization factors \(\mu_V^0\)=-60mV, \(\delta
\mu_V^0\)=10mV, \(\sigma_V^0\)=4mV, \(\delta \sigma_V^0\) = 6mV,
\(\tau_V^{N0}\)=0.5 and \(\delta \tau_V^{N0}\)= 1 arbitrarily delimits
the /fluctuation-driven/ regime (a mean value $x$ and an extent
$\delta x$, \(\forall x \in \{\mu_V, \sigma_V, \tau_V^N\}\)).  They
render the fitting of the phenomenological threshold easier, as they
insure that the coefficients take similar values. It is kept constant
all along the study. The phenomenological threshold was taken as a
second order polynomial and not as a linear threshold, for two
reasons: 1) unlike in an experimental study [[cite:Zerlaut2016]], we are
not limited by the number of sampling points, the number of fitted
coefficients can thus be higher as the probability of overfitting
becomes negligible 2) it gives more flexibility to the template,
indeed the linear threshold was found a good approximation in the
/fluctuation-driven/ regime, i.e. when the diffusion approximation
holds, however, for low values of the presynaptic frequencies, we can
be far from this approximation, the additional coefficients are used
to capture the firing response in those domains.


The fitting procedure was identical to [[citetext:Zerlaut2016]], it
consisted first in a linear regression in the phenomenological
threshold space of Equation [[eq:quadratic-threshold]], followed by a
non-linear optimization of Equation [[eq:template]] on the firing rate
response. Both fitting were performed with the =leastsq= method in the
=optimize= package of =SciPy=.

** Calculus of the subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations

Here, we detail the analytical calculus that translate the input to
the neuron into the properties of the membrane potential
fluctuations. The input is made of two Poisson shotnoise: one
excitatory and one inhibitory that are both convoluted with an
exponential waveform to produce the synaptic conductances time
courses.

*** Conductances fluctuations

From Campbell's theorem [[cite:Papoulis1991]], we first get the mean
(\(\mu_{Ge}, \mu_{Gi}\)) and standard deviation (\(\sigma_{Ge},
\sigma_{Gi}\)) of the excitatory and inhibitory conductance
fluctuations:

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
& \mu_{Ge}(\nu_e, \nu_i) = \nu_e \, K_e \, \tau_e \, Q_e \\
& \sigma_{Ge}(\nu_e, \nu_i) = \sqrt{\frac{\nu_e \, K_e \, \tau_e}{2}} \, Q_e \\
& \mu_{Gi}(\nu_e, \nu_i) = \nu_i \, K_i \, \tau_i \, Q_i \\
& \sigma_{Gi}(\nu_e, \nu_i) = \sqrt{\frac{\nu_i \, K_i \, \tau_i}{2}} \, Q_i 
\end{split}
\end{equation}

The mean conductances will control the input conductance of the neuron
\(\mu_G\) and therefore its effective membrane time constant
\(\tau_m\):

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
& \mu_{G}(\nu_e, \nu_i) = \mu_{Ge} + \mu_{Gi} + g_L \\
& \tau_m(\nu_e, \nu_i) = \frac{C_m}{\mu_{G}}\\
\end{split}
\end{equation}

*** Mean membrane potential

Following [[citetext:Kuhn2004]], the mean membrane potential is obtained
by taking the stationary solution to static conductances given by the
mean synaptic bombardement (for the passive version of Equation
[[eq:iAdExp]], i.e. removing the adaptation and spiking mechanisms). We
obtain:

#+NAME: eq:mu-v
\begin{equation}
\mu_V(\nu_e, \nu_i) = \frac{\mu_{Ge} \, E_e + \mu_{Gi} \, E_i + g_L \, E_L}{\mu_{G}}
\end{equation}

We will now approximate the driving force \(E_s - V(t)\) of synaptic
events by the level resulting from the mean conductance bombardment:
\(E_s - \mu_V\). This will enable an analytical solution for the
standard deviation \( \sigma_V\) and the autocorrelation time \(
\sigma_V\) of the fluctuations/

*** Power spectrum of the membrane potential fluctuations

Obtaining \( \sigma_V\) and \(\tau_V\) is achieved by computing the
power spectrum density of the fluctuations. In the case of Poisson
processes, the power spectrum density of the fluctuations resulting
from the sum of events \(PSP_{s}(t)\) at frequency \(K_{s} \, \nu_s\)
can be obtained from shotnoise theory [[cite:Daley2007]]:

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
 P_V(f)  = & \sum_{s \in \{e,i\}} K_s \, \nu_{s} \, \| \hat{\mathrm{PSP}_s}(f) \|^2
\end{split}
\end{equation}

where \(\hat{\mathrm{PSP}_s}(f)\) is the Fourier transform of the
time-varying function \(\mathrm{PSP}(t)\). Note that the relations
presented in this paper rely on the following convention for the
Fourier transform: \( \hat{F}(f) = \int_\mathbb{R} F(t) \, e^{- 2 i
\pi f t} \, dt\).

After fixing the driving force to \(E_s - \mu_V\), the equation for a
 post-synaptic membrane potential event \(s\) around \(\mu_V\) is

\begin{equation}
 \tau_m \frac{d \, \mathrm{PSP}_s }{dt} + \mathrm{PSP}_s = U_s \, \mathcal{H}(t) \, e^{\frac{-t}{\tau_s}}
\end{split}
\right.
\end{equation}

where \( U_s = \frac{Q_s}{\mu_G} (E_s - \mu_V) \) and \(
\mathcal{H}(t) \) is the Heaviside function.

Its solution is:

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{PSP}_s(t)  = U_s \, \frac{\tau_s}{\tau_m - \tau_s} \, \big( 
e^{\frac{-t}{\tau_m}} - e^{\frac{-t}{\tau_s}} \big) \, \mathcal{H}(t)
\end{equation}

We take the fourier transform:

\begin{equation}
\hat{\mathrm{PSP}_s}(f) = U_s \, \frac{\tau_s}{\tau_m - \tau_s} \, 
\big(
\frac{\tau_{m}}{2 \, i  \,  \pi \, f \, \tau_{m} +1} 
- \frac{\tau_s}{2 \, i  \,  \pi \, f \, \tau_s +1} \big)
\end{equation}

We will need the value of the square modulus at \(f=0\):

#+NAME: eq:psp0
\begin{equation}
\| \hat{\mathrm{PSP}}(0) \|^2 = (U_s \cdot \tau_s)^2
\end{equation}

As well as the integral of the square modulus:

#+NAME: eq:psp-int
\begin{equation}
\int_\mathbb{R}  df \, \| \hat{\mathrm{PSP}}(f) \|^2 = \frac{(U_s \cdot \tau_s)^2}{2 \, (\tau_\mathrm{m}^\mathrm{eff} + \tau_s ) }
\end{equation}

*** Standard deviation of the fluctuations

The standard deviation follows:

\begin{equation}
 (\sigma_V)^2  = \int_\mathbb{R}  df \, P_V(f)
\end{equation}

Using Equation [[eq:psp-int]], we find the final expression for \(\sigma_V\):

#+NAME: eq:sigma-v
\begin{equation}
 \sigma_V(\nu_e, \nu_i)  = \sqrt{ \sum_s K_s \, \nu_s \, \frac{(U_s \cdot \tau_s)^2}{2 \, (\tau_\mathrm{m}^\mathrm{eff} + \tau_s ) } }
\end{equation}

*** Autocorrelation-time of the fluctuations

We defined the global autocorrelation time as [[cite:Zerlaut2016]]:

\begin{equation}
  \tau_V = \frac{1}{2} \, \big( \frac{\int_\mathbb{R} P_V(f) \, d f}{ P_V(0) } \big)^{-1}
\end{equation}

Using Equations [[eq:psp-int]] and [[eq:psp0]], we find the final expression
for \(\tau_V\):

#+NAME: eq:tau-v
\begin{equation}
  \tau_V(\nu_e, \nu_i) = \Big( \frac{
  \sum_s \big( K_s \, \nu_s \, (U_s \cdot \tau_s)^2\big) 
  }{
  \sum_s \big( K_s \, \nu_s \, (U_s \cdot \tau_s)^2 /(\tau_\mathrm{m}^\mathrm{eff} + \tau_s ) \big)
  } \Big)
\end{equation}

Therefore the set of Equations [[eq:mu-v]], [[eq:sigma-v]] and [[eq:tau-v]]
translate the presynaptic frequencies into membrane fluctuations
properties \(\mu_V, \sigma_V, \tau_V\).

The previous methodological section allowed to translate the
fluctuations properties \(\mu_V, \sigma_V, \tau_V\) into a spiking
probability thanks to a minimization procedure. The combination of the
present analytical calculus and the previous fitting procedure (on
numerical simulations data) constitute our semi-analytical approach to
determine the transfer function of a single cell model: \( \nu_{out} =
\mathcal{F}(\nu_e, \nu_i)\).

** Master equation for local population dynamics

An analytical description of the cellular transfer function is the
core of theoretical descriptions of asynchronous dynamics in sparsely
connected random networks [[cite:Amit1997,Brunel2000,Renart2004]].

Because we will investigate relatively slow dynamics
(\(\tau\)>25-50ms) (and because of the stationary formulation of our
transfer function), we will use the Markovian description develloped
in [[citetext:ElBoustani2009]], it describes network activity at a time
scale \(T\), for which the network dynamics should be Markovian. The
choice of the time-scale \(T\) is quite crucial in this formalism, it
should be large enough so that activity can be considered as
memoryless (e.g. it can not be much smaller than the refractory
period, that would introduce memory effects) and small enough so that
each neuron can fire statistically only once per time interval
\(T\). Following [[citetext:ElBoustani2009]], we will arbitrarily take
\(T\)=5ms all along the study as it offers a good compromise between
those two constraints.

[[../figures/tf.png]]

This kind of input-output functions lie at the core of /mean-field/
models of population dynamics, reviewed in [[citetext:Renart2004]]. Note
here that the formulation of the transfer function imply a stationary
hypothesis: both for the input (stationary Poisson processes) and the
output firing (a stationary firing rate). 

A commonly adopted strategy for solving this problem analytically is
to approximate the time course of the synaptic conductances by the
realisation of a stochastic process (here it would be an
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process because of the /exponential/ synaptic
events). The problem can thus be formulated in terms of a
multi-dimensional stochastic process for which an equation that
describes the probability density can be derived: the Fokker-Planck
equation. The firing rate is then given by the first-passage time
through the threshold of the integrate and fire model (either simple
integrate and fire or exponential integrate and fire model)

Because an analytical solution of this function for the single neuron
considered here is a very challenging mathematical problem, we adopted
a semi-analytical approach. The procedure relied on fitting a
/phenomenological threshold/ that accounts for the single neuron
non-linearities (spiking and reset mechanism, adaptation mechanisms)
on top of the subthreshold integration effects [[cite:Zerlaut2016]].


We will therefore study in the following what are the limitations
introduced by this stationary hypothesis in the description of the
temporal dynamics of network activity.

* Discussion
\normalsize


We investigate whether the Markovian formalismm proposed in
[[citetext:ElBoustani2009]] is able to describe the temporal dynamics of
artificial neural networks. Answering this kind of question precisely
set what is the relevance of /stationary/ responses and what are real
transient effects.
