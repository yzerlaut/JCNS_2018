* Key points summary
\bfseries

- Extension of [[citetext:ElBoustani2009]] to temporal dynamics.

- Comparison with numerical simulations.

- Investigating the integrative properties of the mean field model.

- Implementation in a ring geometry to describe the spatial
  integration across the neocortical sheet.

- Comparison with optical imaging of spatio-temporal dynamics in the
  primary visual cortex of awake behaving monkey.
