** Lateral propagation in sensory neocortex


- upstream circuits (from sensory receptors to layer IV) are highly
  structured, then this strong specificity is lost in Layer II/III
  \vspace{.5cm}

- It should make downstream readout very complex !! \vspace{.5cm}

- Indeed, it impedes sensory performances ! \\
  \rightarrow neural substrate of illusory motion (Jancke et al. 2004)

Why ? Functional role ? \vspace{.5cm}

Should be linked to the representation of global stimuli...

** Lateral propagation in sensory neocortex

General idea: \\

"Spread sensory responses might correspond to a 'wake-up' call for
driving the cortex to an active state"\\

precise modalities ?
- what's the functional advantage of a shift to a more active state ?
- quantitative evidence ?

** Lateral propagation in neocortex: theoretical approach

Modeling of neocortical dynamics

- /bottom-up/ approach to model neocortical dynamics (Zerlaut, PhD
  thesis, in prep.)\\
  $\rightarrow$ precise description of the integrative properties of
  neocortical networks\\
  Mean-field approach (El Boustani & Destexhe, 2009) to obtain the
  properties emerging at the network level from the cellular
  properties (Zerlaut et al., /submitted/)

- macroscopic models of the neocortical sheet including lateral
  connectivity\\
  $\rightarrow$ exhibit the lateral propagation of activity observed
  in neocortex and the resulting suppressive interactions between
  colliding responses to sensory stimuli (Chemla et al., /in prep./)

\vspace{.3cm}

$\rightarrow$ Allow to formulate and test precise hypothesis of the
putative functional role of lateral propagation

* Response to local stimuli

** Response to local stimuli

In the remaining : \vspace{1cm}

Local stimulus = Deflection of a single arc or a single row

** Response to local stimuli: 1) lateral propagation

Examples of single arc deflections

** Response to local stimuli: 2) single trial variability

in the remaining, we focus on a simple and putatively
physiologically relevant response feature: its integral.

* Response to complex stimuli
  
** The expected combinatorial variability for complex stimuli

\pause
\vspace{.5cm}

*Do neocortical response show the trace of this combinatorial variability ?*

** The response to complex stimuli shows a strong reduction in variability compared to the linear prediction

\pause

\vspace{.5cm}

Intracortical interactions have a mechanism to reduce the variability of complex stimuli

\vspace{.5cm}

\pause

Putative network mechanism underlying this phenomena ?

* Network mechanism

** Single trial variability emerges from the dependency on ongoing dynamics

Arieli et al., /Science/ 1996

** Lateral propagation bias neighboring levels of ongoing dynamics to control its response level

** Key mechanisms

- Lateral propagation \vspace{1cm}

- A monotonic relationship between "ongoing dynamics" and "response level"

** Key mechanisms : potentiation would do the same

The mechanism does not rely on suppression !! \vspace{.5cm}

** Key mechanisms : fancy functions would break the mechanism

** Conclusion

Given the constrain that the response to a stimulus depends on local
ongoing activity: \vspace{.5cm}

*Lateral propagation is a way to supports reliable representations of
complex stimuli in the barrel cortex*

** Perspectives

- more measures of single trial variability
