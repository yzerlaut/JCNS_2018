* Key points summary
\bfseries

- \LaTeX \, is very powerful for generating scientific manuscripts

- =Org-Mode= allows to focus on the content (and of course it is based
  on =emacs=)

- We get the best of both worlds: we write in =Org-Mode= and we use
  the =export-to-latex= function of emacs to export to \LaTeX. Here
  is an example implementation of

- Export and Compilation workflow automated with =doit= (visit
  [[http://pydoit.org/]])

# \newpage

* Abstract
\bfseries

*Org-Mode* is for keeping notes, maintaining TODO lists, planning
projects, and authoring documents with a fast and effective plain-text
system. Visit http://orgmode.org/.

Here we build up a template for scientific papers with the following
characteristics:

- Options for generating manuscripts for submission to the following
  biology journals:
  - [[http://www.jneurosci.org/][Journal of Neuroscience]]
  - [[http://jp.msubmit.net/cgi-bin/main.plex][Journal of Physiology]]

* Introduction

\blindtext[1], where we reference to the results
section[[sec:results]]. And also to Equation [[eq:first]] and Figure [[fig:1]] and
by referencing to [[citetext:Tuckwell1998b]] with two possible citation
formats : either within the text as [[citetext:Destexhe2003]] or with
parentheses [[cite:Destexhe2003,Brette2005]] as commonly used in biology
journals.

* Additional information

All manuscripts must contain a statement regarding Competing interests
and Funding. If you have no competing interests or have not receiving
funding, statements to this effect must be included. This will be
published under a section entitled Additional Information at the end

** Author contributions.

This section must state the laboratory where the experiments were
performed and list the contribution (in words) of each author (using
their initials) to the following aspects of the study:

    1. conception or design of the work; or
    2. acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work; AND
    3. drafting the work or revising it critically for important intellectual content.

All authors must have contributed to 1 or 2 AND 3.

This section must also confirm that all authors:

    4. approved the final version of the manuscript; AND
    5. agree to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved; AND
    6. all persons designated as authors qualify for authorship, and all those who qualify for authorship are listed.

Contributors who do not meet the above criteria for authorship should not be listed as authors, but have their contribution (e.g. acquisition of funding, general supervision of a research group, general administrative support, writing assistance, technical editing, language editing, or proofreading) listed in the Acknowledgements.

Additional information such as ‘X and Y have contributed equally to this work’ may be added as a footnote on the title page.

** Funding.

Authors must indicate all sources of funding, including grant
numbers. If authors have not received funding, this must be stated.


** Acknowledgements.

Acknowledgements should be the minimum consistent with courtesy. The
wording of acknowledgements of scientific assistance or advice must
